RPM packages for the configure-osg and ini files

osg-configure uses Distutils to create tarballs and installs instead of a
makefile.  To get tarball from osg-configure svn checkout, make sure the 
setup.py and Manifest.in are up to date, then run python setup.py sdist .  
The tarball will be in dist/  .
