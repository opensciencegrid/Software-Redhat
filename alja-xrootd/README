This build includes "compat" packages that are built from the XRootD 4 sources.
To update the compat packages:

**Steps:**
- Download the source from xrootd.org: follow the link in the announcement email, then click the "Source" link.
  Or use http://xrootd.org/download/v${VERSION}/xrootd-${VERSION}.tar.gz
  (where ${VERSION} is the new version of XRootD 4)

  If you can't use that URL for some reason (e.g. permission denied), download the archive from GitHub
  by finding the appropriate tag: https://github.com/xrootd/xrootd/tags

- Put the tarball in the usual upstream area and update "xrootd-compat.tarball.source"

- Edit "osg/xrootd.spec" and update the "%define compat_version" line

- Bump the release and add %changelog entry

- Build


We sometimes fork their repo and apply commits.  In that case, here's how to build the SRPM:

**Steps:** (for an example v5.4.3-rc4.1 tag)
# clone the repo, including submodules, and switch to the tag
# make tags with the same name in submodules src/XrdClHttp and src/XrdCeph

podman run -i -t --rm -v $PWD:/xrootd centos:7 bash
      yum-config-manager --enablerepo powertools >/dev/null
      yum install -y epel-release
      yum install -y rpm-build python-srpm-macros epel-srpm-macros which git
      cd /xrootd/packaging
      ./makesrpm.sh --version 5.4.3
