We have packages that depend on "gridengine" (particularly the Globus
SGE job manager), but some sites install in other ways, such as via
tarballs. They don't want to install EPEL's gridengine RPMs just to
satisfy the dependncy. Therefore this RPM claims to provide
gridengine, while in fact providing nothing at all.
