The HTCondor-CE provides a remote interface to the local batch system.
It is comparable to other gatekeeper software (such as GRAM or CREAM), but is
entirely built out of HTCondor components.  It is a special configuration of
HTCondor and has no daemon components not provided by the HTCondor team.

The spec file is from the HTCondor-CE source code itself.  Updates done in the
OSG should be sent back upstream; there are no known reasons to have the two
copies be different.

UPSTREAM: https://github.com/opensciencegrid/htcondor-ce

To build from upstream:

git archive --prefix=htcondor-ce-{VERSION}/ {GIT REVISION} | gzip -9 > htcondor-ce-{VERSION}.tar.gz

Notes:
- The tarball used in 1.6-2 was built from https://github.com/matyasselmeci/condor-ce
and 1.9-* was built from:
https://github.com/opensciencegrid/htcondor-ce/commit/01bc40cbc529c1ce1e0409c5fc5afda4c3e9127c
- Starting with 1.14, we include a patch to drop the userHome function since it's included in upstream
HTCondor 8.3.6. This cannot be pushed upstream since OSG 3.2 is still on 8.2.x.
