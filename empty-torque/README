We have packages that depend on "torque-server" and "torque-client"
(particularly the Globus PBS job manager), but some sites install in
other ways, such as PBSPro. They don't want to install EPEL's torque
RPMs just to satisfy the dependncy. Therefore this RPM claims to
provide PBS, while in fact providing nothing at all.
