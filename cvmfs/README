CernVM File System (CernVM-FS) is a network file system based on HTTP 
and optimized to deliver experiment software in a fast, scalable, 
and reliable way. Files and file metadata are aggressively cached 
and downloaded on demand. Thereby the CernVM-FS decouples the life 
cycle management of the application software releases from the operating 
system. CernVM-FS is included in CernVM, however it can also be used 
outside CernVM. To download CernVM-FS please go to:
