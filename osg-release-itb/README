osg-release is the yum repository setup required to install OSG software.  
This release includes:
 - Production (named 'osg') (default)
 - Testing
 - Development
 - Minefield (Directly off koji)
 - Pre-Release (Directly off koji)

The osg-release is designed for both el5 and el6.  It only installs the
appropriate repo files for the platform.

By default, only the Production repo is enabled.  This can be changed by 
editing the yum.repos.d/osg-*.repo files and setting:
enabled=1
