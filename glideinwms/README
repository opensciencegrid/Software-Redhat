Package: glideinwms-vofrontend

This is a glideinWMS VO Frontend package for OSG.

We are re-publishing the srpm, taken from
http://koji.hep.caltech.edu/public/packages/glideinwms-vofrontend/2.5.1/12/src/glideinwms-vofrontend-2.5.1-12.src.rpm

#The spec file is taken directly from the upstream SRPM, so we don't have one in the osg subdir.
The spec file is modified to include the dependencies that are in the vdt repos.
