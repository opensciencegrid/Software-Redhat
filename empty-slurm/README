The gratia-probe-slurm package requires slurm, but slurm itself is not
available from any of the standard osg repos, and it appears you can't get it
at all anywhere for el5.

So for now, empty-slurm exists solely for the sake of testing installs of
gratia-probe-slurm with just the standard repos, OS + EPEL + OSG.
