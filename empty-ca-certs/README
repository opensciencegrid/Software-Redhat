We have several packages that depend on "grid-certificates", and we
have several RPMs that provide "grid-certificates", so that people
have their choice in how to install them. As of today (12-Sep-2011),
these choices are:

  igtf-ca-certs
  igft-ca-certs-compat
  osg-ca-certs
  osg-ca-certs-compat
  osg-ca-scripts

That's good for people that want to install the CA certificates in a
normal way, but several sites have made it clear  that they would
like to install the CA certificates on their own. They'll probably
install them in NFS, then make a symlnk from
/etc/grid-security/certifictes to that location. 

To make this possibility clear and explicit, we have this package,
empty-ca-certs.  It's an empty RPM (it provides no files), but it claims
to provide "grid-certificates". This will satisfy the RPM dependencies
yet let sites manage the CA certificates on their own. 

Note that this package used to be called "no-ca-certs", but that meant
that sometimes yum would choose it instead of osg-ca-certs (because
yum has a crazy dependency resolution algorithm that includes length
of name), so we've renamed this to be empty-ca-certs.
