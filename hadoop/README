Hadoop 2.0.0 notes:

- I have re-built based on the Cloudera CDH4 update 2 RPM
with some updates to get it to build


Packager notes:

- This build is inherited from the hadoop-0.20 package in the
dist-el5-hadoop20 branch of the caltech koji repository:
https://koji.hep.caltech.edu/koji/index

- the original source rpm is copied from the cloudera repository:
http://archive.cloudera.com/redhat/cdh/3b3/SRPMS/

- OSG patches have been added:
  - Apache forrest has been added and patched such that it can be built without Java 5.
  - HADOOP-6813.  See upstream ticket.
  - HDFS-780.  See upstream ticket.
  - A few FUSE memory leaks have been fixed.
  - Bootstrapping the CLASSPATH and the JRE location has been made more reliable.
